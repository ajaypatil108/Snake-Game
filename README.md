# C++ Nano degree Capstone : Snake Game 

 I added features to the 2d snake game for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The starter code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gave me a chance to integrate what I've leart throughout this program. 

In this project, I extended the Snake game, following the principles I learnt throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project demonstrates that I can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.
